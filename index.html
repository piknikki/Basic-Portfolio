    <p>Do you think it's right for Marceline to invite us to jam without Princess and BMO? It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with? Yeah, man. Balloon music is the future. Listen. Pretty good. I don't think you mastered it yet. Well, duh. I just started.</p>
    <p>Oh, dude. There's a note. What's it say? Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back, blee-bloo-blop, Don't go in my house. That's it? Yeah. Just Don't go in my house in all caps... written in blood. </p>
    Hmm. What are you doing?
    <p>Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time. Come on! I can't do that! Let's play Cloud Hunt 'til she gets here. No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt! Yeah, that's what makes it awesome, 'cause I know I'll win. Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now explain the rules 'cause I forget. Okay. I count to ten and you go hide somewhere. Then, I gotta try to find you. You can hide... anywhere in here. Anywhere in here, ...but Marcy's house is off limits because she said so. Okay? Got it. Okay. I'm gonna start counting. Ready? Yes. Go</p>
